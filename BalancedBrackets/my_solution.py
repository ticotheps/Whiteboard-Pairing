# Understanding the Problem

  # Objective: to determine whether or not brackets are used properly

  # Expected Input: string of opening/closing brackets

  # Expected Output: True or False
  
  # Balanced = 2 of each kind of bracket

# Devising a Plan

  # (1) Create a dictionary of openers to store items that I have visted.
  # (2) Create a stack to loop through because you can always access most recent item.
  # (3) Convert input string to an array of items.
  # 
  # (4) Push those items into the stack.
  # (5) Loop through the stack...
      # (6) ...If item is an opener, find out the value of that key in the opener's dictionary...
          # (7) ...If the value of 
      # (5) ...if it exists in the opener dictionary, check to see if it's value (a closer) exists in the other dictionary of closers.
